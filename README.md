# Purpose and Benefit
#### Welcome to my portfolio! This website is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences across the fields of <b>Frontend Development</b> and <b>Data Science</b>.  
  It reflects my journey as a developer—building responsive and optimized web applications while also exploring the power of data through analysis, visualization, and machine learning.  
  From elegant UI interfaces to intelligent, data-driven solutions, I’m passionate about crafting impactful digital experiences. Dive in to explore the technologies I work with and the projects I’ve brought to life!

# Setup of the website
#### Download the zip file and follow the instructions below to run it in your machine
#### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


# Outcome 
#### The project has a navbar for easy navigation between sections as this is a single page website. It then has an about section with a link to my coding profile (specifically Leetcode here) , skills section showcasing all programming languages, the tools, libraries and frameworks I know, followed by a project section showcasing some projects that i have developed so far. Lastly it has a footer with the links to my Linkedin and Github profiles for connections and collaborations.
