#### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

# Outcome 
#### The project has a navbar for easy navigation between sections as this is a single page website. It then has an about section with a link to my coding profile (specifically Leetcode here) , skills section showcasing all the tools and fraeworks I know followed by a project section showcasing some projects that i have developed so far. Lastly it has a footer with the links to my Linkedin and Github profiles for connections and collaborations.
